	/// <summary>
	///   A model representation of an auction, of which each auction running in a system would have
	///   an instance of this class to manage the operations.
	/// 
	///   Some interesting points in the design so far.
	/// 
	///   Channels work, particularly for commands sent to the actor (Bid, Ask)
	/// 
	///   Responses are absolutely ugly, having to be part of the command message sent to the actor
	///   There has to be a better way to handle this
	/// 
	///   Current thought is the creation of a "Mailbox" concept, whereby any type of message can be
	///   sent to the mailbox, and the mailbox will ensure proper delivery of messages to the appropriate channels
	/// 
	///   At the same time, a form of reservation that could be created and packaged with a message (including something
	///   similar to a MessageId or TransactionId, wrapped inside a Future() object) would support an easier notion of 
	///   binding a continuation to the receive of a response message.
	/// 
	///   This mailbox concept could be wrapped around an actor (or part of the api itself) to allow typed sends to the actor without
	///   knowing the specific input channel at the time of send
	/// 
	///   An actor repository, or something similar to that, would provide location services or something to deal with the 
	///   connection of actors. For instance, if a search is performed to find auctions for boats, the response would include a 
	///   list of actors, one for each auction. It may be that the query is sent to an actor, and a list of actors is returned
	///   instead. Not sure here, but clearly a way to map a message/guid to an instance is important.
	/// 
	///   It may just be the KeyedChannel that I created, whereas a message is sent to a keyed channel, which then 
	///   delivers it to the actor method itself.
